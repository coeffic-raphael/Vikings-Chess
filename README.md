## üéÆ Game Rules (Simplified)
- You can read the entire rules here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafl_games
- The game is played on an **11x11 board**.  
- **Player 1 (Defender)** controls the **King** and 12 Pawns.  
- **Player 2 (Attacker)** controls 24 Pawns.  
- The **goal for Player 1** is to move the King to one of the **four corners**.  
- The **goal for Player 2** is to **capture the King** by surrounding him on all 4 sides.  
- Pawns can capture by flanking enemy pieces horizontally or vertically.
